Architecture and Data Flow
Overview
The architecture of the Taste of Gratitude Ionic E-Commerce App follows a modular, component-driven design using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) paradigm. It is designed to optimize scalability, maintainability, and reusability while ensuring a seamless user experience. The app leverages Ionic Framework for its UI and Capacitor for native device features.

User Interface (UI):

Built with Ionic Framework, the UI includes components like buttons, forms, and product cards.
Pages include Home, Product Detail, Cart, and Checkout.
Components such as the navbar, footer, and product cards are reusable.
Services Layer:

Manages business logic and interactions between the UI and external APIs (e.g., Stripe).
Includes Cart Service for cart management, Payment Service for Stripe integration, and Product Service for fetching data.
Local Storage:

Uses Ionic Storage to persist cart data locally for offline or temporary access.
External APIs:

Stripe API: Handles payment processing via payment intents.
Backend API (Optional): Used to dynamically fetch or update product information.
Detailed Architecture

1. Frontend (UI) Layer
   Role: Provides a responsive and user-friendly interface for users to interact with the app.
   Components:
   Pages:
   Home Page: Displays a grid of products fetched from the Product Service.
   Product Detail Page: Provides detailed information about a selected product.
   Cart Page: Lists items in the user's cart with options to modify.
   Checkout Page: Captures user details and processes payments.
   Reusable Components:
   ProductCardComponent: Displays product name, image, and price.
   NavbarComponent: Provides navigation links across the app.
2. Service Layer
   Role: Manages business logic, state management, and API interactions.
   Key Services:
   Cart Service:
   Tracks items added to the cart.
   Stores cart data in Ionic Storage.
   Methods:
   addToCart(product)
   removeFromCart(productId)
   getCart()
   Payment Service:
   Interacts with Stripe API to process payments.
   Methods:
   processPayment(amount)
   createPaymentIntent(amount, currency)
   Product Service:
   Fetches product details from a mock JSON file or backend API.
   Methods:
   getProducts()
   getProductById(productId)
3. Local Storage Layer
   Role: Provides lightweight persistence for cart and user data.
   Technology: Uses @ionic/storage-angular to store data locally.
   Use Case: Ensures the cart remains accessible if the app is closed or network connectivity is lost.
4. External APIs
   Stripe API:
   Handles secure payment processing.
   Creates and confirms payment intents.
   Backend API (Optional):
   Provides dynamic product updates or additional user-related features.
   Example: Node.js + Express or Firebase.
   Data Flow
5. Adding a Product to Cart
   User clicks "Add to Cart" on a product card.
   CartService.addToCart(product) is called, updating local storage with the selected product.
   The Cart Page retrieves cart items using CartService.getCart().
6. Displaying Products
   On the Home Page, ProductService.getProducts() fetches data from a JSON file or backend API.
   The Home Page renders a grid of products using ProductCardComponent.
7. Processing Payments
   On the Checkout Page, the user enters payment details.
   PaymentService.createPaymentIntent(amount) is called to generate a payment intent from Stripe.
   PaymentService.processPayment() confirms the payment intent.
   The app displays a success message upon payment completion.

   Best Practices
   Modularization: Split features into small, reusable services and components.
   Scalability: Use BehaviorSubjects for shared state management to enable real-time updates.
   Security: Store sensitive data like API keys in environment files and keep them out of the codebase.
   Error Handling: Gracefully handle API and payment errors to enhance user experience.
   Future Enhancements
   User Authentication: Use Firebase for login and user management.
   Push Notifications: Notify users of special offers or cart reminders.
   Order History: Store past orders for user convenience.
   Dynamic Backend: Integrate with a backend to manage inventory in real-time.
