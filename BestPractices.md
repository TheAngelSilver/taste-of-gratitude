Coding Standards and Conventions for Taste of Gratitude Ionic App

1. General Guidelines
   Consistency is Key: Maintain consistent coding styles across files for readability and maintainability.
   Use TypeScript Best Practices:
   Strict typing is mandatory for all variables, functions, and return types.
   Avoid the use of any unless absolutely necessary.
   Code Modularity: Break the code into small, reusable components and services to promote reusability and testability.
   Follow Angular Style Guide: Adopt Angular’s official style guide for project structure, naming conventions, and file organization.
2. Naming Conventions
   File and Folder Names:
   Use kebab-case for file and folder names.
   Example: product-card.component.ts, home.page.ts
   Component Names:
   Use PascalCase for component names.
   Example: ProductCardComponent, NavbarComponent
   Variable Names:
   Use camelCase for variables, functions, and properties.
   Example: productList, fetchProducts()
   Service Names:
   Use PascalCase with a Service suffix.
   Example: CartService, PaymentService
   Constants:
   Use UPPER_CASE with underscores.
   Example: API_URL, MAX_CART_ITEMS
3. Code Organization
   Folder Structure:
   Group related functionality into modules and components (as detailed in the project’s folder structure).
   Use services for business logic and data handling to separate concerns from the UI layer.
   File Structure:
   Keep each component in its own folder containing .ts, .html, and .scss files.
   Example:
   plaintext
   Copy code
   /product-card
   ├── product-card.component.ts
   ├── product-card.component.html
   └── product-card.component.scss
   Service Layer:
   Encapsulate API calls and business logic in services.
   Keep services stateless whenever possible.
4. Coding Standards
   TypeScript Rules:
   Enable strict mode in tsconfig.json:
   json
   Copy code
   {
   "compilerOptions": {
   "strict": true,
   "noImplicitAny": true,
   "strictNullChecks": true
   }
   }
   Comments:
   Use JSDoc-style comments for classes, methods, and significant logic.
   Example:
   typescript
   Copy code
   /\*\*

- Adds a product to the cart.
- @param product The product to add
  \*/
  addToCart(product: Product): void {
  this.cart.push(product);
  }
  Error Handling:
  Handle errors gracefully, especially during API calls.
  Example:
  typescript
  Copy code
  this.http.get('/products').subscribe({
  next: (data) => this.products = data,
  error: (err) => console.error('Failed to fetch products', err),
  });

5. CSS and Styling
   Styling Conventions:
   Use SCSS for styling.
   Follow BEM (Block Element Modifier) methodology for class naming.
   Example:
   scss
   Copy code
   .product-card {
   &\_\_title {
   font-size: 16px;
   color: #333;
   }

&--highlighted {
background-color: #f0f0f0;
}
}
Responsive Design:
Use Ionic’s grid and utility classes for layout and responsiveness.
Leverage CSS variables for themes and consistent color schemes. 6. Angular-Specific Best Practices
Component Design:
Smart vs. Dumb Components:
Smart components (pages) handle logic and state.
Dumb components (UI components) focus on rendering and emitting events.
Change Detection:
Use OnPush change detection for performance optimization when applicable.
Routing:
Define routes in app-routing.module.ts.
Use lazy loading for feature modules to reduce initial load time. 7. Performance Optimization
Lazy Load Modules: Load only necessary modules/pages on demand.
Avoid Over-Nesting: Keep the component hierarchy shallow.
Optimize API Calls: Use RxJS operators like switchMap to prevent redundant requests.
Image Optimization:
Compress images before adding them to assets.
Use responsive images where applicable. 8. Testing Standards
Unit Testing:
Write unit tests for components, services, and utilities.
Use Jasmine/Karma for test cases.
E2E Testing:
Use Cypress for end-to-end testing.
Coverage Goals:
Aim for at least 80% coverage across all files. 9. Git Workflow
Use meaningful commit messages following the conventional format:
[type] description
Example: feat: add product detail page
Branch naming convention:
feature/<feature-name>, fix/<issue-name> 10. Accessibility (A11Y)
Use semantic HTML elements where applicable.
Add aria-label attributes to interactive elements.
Test with screen readers for usability.
